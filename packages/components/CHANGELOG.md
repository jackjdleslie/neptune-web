# v15.2.1
## Define CSS files as `sideEffects`
We were experiencing issues with `es` modules and `next`: CSS from components was not included in the extracted CSS chunk. Initially I thought this is an issue in `next-css` or `next-transpile-modules` but the output was fixed by changing the `sideEffects` flag.

## Allow adding custom action label and Select elemnt props as node

This is necessary for translations

# v4.2.0
## Allow adding custom action to the end of MoneyInput options

# v4.1.2
## Change internal popover markup

Previously, popover created a container element for the trigger passed as a child and the popover itself, and overrode styles to make the popover itself not be styled like the container that acted as a trigger.

Now, popover decorates the trigger passed as a child with accessibility props and an event handler, removing the need for a wrapper element and custom styles.

This also enables focus style support out of the box.

# v4.1.1
## Make popover title accept React elements as type

This is necessary when we pass in translated strings using `retranslate` `Message` component.

# v4.1.0
## Add popover component

# v2.0.5

- Disable preventDefault of SPACE entirely when typed into searchBox (need for option selection, opening of Select)

# v2.0.4
## Remove babel-preset-react-app
- The React preset for Babel was shipped with `useBuiltIns: true` which led to broken functionality in IE
- The caveat is bundle size increased from ~13 Kb to ~19Kb.

# v2.0.3
## Move babel config to babelrc file
- This should allow this module to be used within a babel 7 setup by not publishing its babelrc config

# v2.0.2
## Select - search with space
- Fix ability to type SPACE in the search box input field of Select (skip preventDefault when typing into the search field)

# v2.0.1
## Make flow navigation more flexible

# v1.0.3
## Make stepper tooltips only appear on non-touch devices

Tooltips on the stepper on touch devices have caused problems with going back and overall confusion because of their behaviour, so we removed them.

# v1.0.2
## Make stepper tooltips adapt to length and not go off screen

Stepper tooltips max width now 100%. In sm and md screens the first and last tooltips are moved so they won't go offscreen.
