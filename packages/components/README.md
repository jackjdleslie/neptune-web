[![NPM](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40transferwise%2Fcomponents.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@transferwise/components)

`yarn add @transferwise/components`

This is a port of our styleguide components to react.

[Documentation and demo can be found here](https://transferwise.github.io/components/)

Heavily a work in progress.

Work that still needs doing:
- Missing styleguide components

## Contributing

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. 
3. Then run `npm run dev` to get a live-reloading dev environment
4. **For tests** run `npm run test:watch` to run livereloading tests.


Add components in feature branches, before creating a pull request **update changelog and semantic version** so the branch will be deployed and can be shared.

Docs will be automatically deployed when merging to master, and a new npm release (with corresponding github release) will be created as well. Be sure to increment the version in `package.json` according to semver.


## Usage
The library is distributed in two versions:UMD and ES6

### ES6 Tree shakeable
JS

    import { ComponentName } from "@transferwise/components

CSS

No need to import any css as every component only import its own style.

For NextJs user please add to config:

    transpileModules: ['@transferwise/components']


#### UMD

In order to consume the umd bundle (non tree shakeable) please use 

JS

    import { ComponentName } from "@transferwise/components/build/main.js

CSS

    import "@transferwise/components/build/main.css
